##What this project is about

This project is a Java application that allows users to create UML diagrams, as well as generate template code in Java for their UML diagrams. 
It supports the ability to emphasize design patterns in your UML diagrams by letting users attach patterns to classes. 
Design patterns can beconnected visually with lines to emphasize relationships such as between observers and observable classes. 
In addition, this application supports UML connections between classes such as association, aggregation, composition, generalization, and realization. 
Once a user presses run, under the tools menu bar options, the program will generate template code as well as allow users to modify the template to start creating java programs. 
Users can save their work to their local machine's desktop in the form of a .ser (serializable file format) and open .ser files to continue their work.
This application provides an easy to understand and use interface for a user to quickly develop UML diagrams and start generating code.
